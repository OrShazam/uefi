A minoca based UEFI coreboot payload (WIP)

[yabits/uefi](https://github.com/yabits/uefi) is an UEFI coreboot payload.
The code is based on the part of [Minoca OS](https://github.com/minoca/os).
Minoca OS has minimal UEFI implementation for some platforms,
like BeagleBone Black, Paspberry Pi and Legacy BIOS.
This project is trying to port the code base to coreboot as a payload.
Our goal is running Linux, \*BSDs and other bootloaders from this firmware.

## Building

Before building, clone
[coreboot](http://review.coreboot.org/p/coreboot)
and build
[Libpayload](https://www.coreboot.org/Libpayload).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yabits/uefi.git
$ cd uefi
$ make menuconfig
$ make
```
